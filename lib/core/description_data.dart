    '''Mehendi, otherwise known as henna, is a paste associated with positive spirits and good luck. Indian Wedding tradition calls for a Mehendi ceremony to be held the night before the wedding as a way of wishing the bride good health and prosperity as she makes her journey on to marriage.

The core significance of applying Mehendi is to utilize its natural medicinal herbal remedies, cooling the body and relieving of any stress before the big day.

Mehendi is considered as the oldest form of body art that has ever been into existence. The word ‘mehendi’ comes from a Sanskrit word, ‘mendhika’, which refers directly to the henna plant itself. The usage of mehendi dates back to the time prior to the Vedic Age. Traces of henna being used in mummification have also been found. Also, it is believed that the beautiful princess, Cleopatra used henna to paint her body.

Established in 1978 with a vision to change the way we see Gujarati food, Mr. Surendra Patel pioneered the idea of a restaurant that wouldn’t only serve food to the guests but would also give them an experience. Guests would escape the urban cityscapes and go back to their roots in a rustic and homely environment.

Cozied within a lush green cover, Vishalla is home to a volley of local and migratory birds, rare flowers and two museums apart from a beautiful party plot and banquet.''',
    '''Marriage, a sacred tie, a union of two souls and the coming together of two families as one big family. Today we are not here as the groom’s or the bride’s family but one big family.

Tonight is all about joy, happiness and excitement. It’s about dancing our way to the wedding, singing out songs and blessings and most importantly getting to know one another.

Garba is a dance that honors, worships, and celebrates the feminine form of divinity. The word "garba" comes from the Sanskrit word garbha, meaning "womb." Traditionally, the dance is performed by women in a circle around a clay lantern with a light inside, called a garbha deep ("womb lamp").

Garba is performed in a circle (concentric circles when there are many people). The circle represents the Hindu view of time. In Hinduism, time is cyclical. As the cycle of time revolves, from birth to life to death to rebirth, the only thing that is constant is the Goddess, an unmoving symbol in the midst of all of this unending and infinite movement. The dance symbolizes that God, represented in feminine form in this case, is the only thing that remains unchanging in a constantly changing universe.''',
    '''The haldi ceremony marks the beginning of the wedding rituals. The ceremony is held on the morning of the wedding day at the residence of both groom and bride respectively. A paste prepared with turmeric (haldi), curd, sandalwood, gram flour primarily, is rubbed onto the bride’s and groom’s skin before a ceremonial bath.

Turmeric is considered extremely auspicious for Hindu rituals. 
Turmeric is extremely good for the skin. It gives the skin a healthy glow and ensures the bride and the groom look fresh during the most important occasion of their lives. The beautification property of haldi makes the haldi ceremony an important ritual in Indian weddings.
Massaging the ubtan onto the skin relaxes the body and takes the mind off the tension. It also has an antioxidant called curcumin that acts as a mild counter to depression and anxiety which helps the bride and the groom stay calm for the wedding.

The colour yellow is indeed associated with new beginnings, peace and happiness.''',
    '''The jaan (baarat in Gujarati), held on the wedding day, is a very entertaining, sweet and funny ritual. It refers to the groom and a party of people consisting of his friends and family who accompany him to the marriage venue. The sister of the groom waves a pouch of coins over the head of the groom to keep off any bad luck or the “evil eye”. Then the procession sets off with the groom on horseback and the accompanying party dances and bursts crackers while arriving at the marriage venue.

After arriving at the marriage venue, the groom touches his soon-to-be mother-in-law’s feet for her blessings, and she tries to grab his nose while he tries to avoid her clutch. This playful ritual is to remind the groom that she is giving her precious daughter to him, so he should be humble and grateful.''',
    '''Jaimala or varmala: The bride and the groom meet for the first time on the wedding day with this ritual which commences the start of the main wedding rituals. It is an indication of acceptance of each other as their spouse, and a pledge to respect them throughout the rest of their lives. They exchange garlands.

Antarpaat: The bride now arrives at the mandap led by her maternal uncle and an opaque cloth is placed between the bride and the groom like a curtain as the mantras of the Gujarati wedding is chanted.
The cloth signifies their individual lives and existence prior to the ceremony. Removing the antarpat signifies two souls becoming one.

Kanyadaan: This ritual symbolizes the father of the bride placing his trust on his son-in-law. From now on, his son-in-law is responsible for the happiness of his daughter.

Hasta Milap: The priest now ties one end of the groom’s shawl to one end of the bride’s saree.The tying of knot and the joined hands of the couple are symbolic of the meeting of two hearts and souls. The acharya or the priest chants mantras and seeks the blessings of Goddess Laxmi and Parvatiji for the couple.

Pheras: Unlike other Indian cultures, in a Gujarati wedding, the couple takes four pheras, instead of seven, around the sacred fire. The four pheras have immense significance in the marriage. Each of them symbolizes one goal of human life –Dharma, Artha, Kama and Moksha.

Saptapadi: It is an important step of any Hindu marriage. In a typical Gujarati Marriage, the groom helps the bride in touching the seven betel nuts with her right toe, while both of them recite the seven vows for their commitment towards each other. At each step of the Saptapadi, the groom asks for support from his bride throughout his life.

Saubhagyavati bhava: This is a way to bless the newly wedded couple. In this tradition, seven married women from the bride’s family whisper good wishes and blessings in the right ear of the bride. They bless her to remain a Saubhagyavati i.e. lucky throughout her life.
