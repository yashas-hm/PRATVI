    '''Mehendi, otherwise known as henna, is a paste associated with positive spirits and good luck. Indian Wedding tradition calls for a Mehendi ceremony to be held the night before the wedding as a way of wishing the bride good health and prosperity as she makes her journey on to marriage.

The core significance of applying Mehendi is to utilize its natural medicinal herbal remedies, cooling the body and relieving of any stress before the big day.

Mehendi is considered as the oldest form of body art that has ever been into existence. The word ‘mehendi’ comes from a Sanskrit word, ‘mendhika’, which refers directly to the henna plant itself. The usage of mehendi dates back to the time prior to the Vedic Age. Traces of henna being used in mummification have also been found. Also, it is believed that the beautiful princess, Cleopatra used henna to paint her body.

Established in 1978 with a vision to change the way we see Gujarati food, Mr. Surendra Patel pioneered the idea of a restaurant that wouldn’t only serve food to the guests but would also give them an experience. Guests would escape the urban cityscapes and go back to their roots in a rustic and homely environment.

    '''Marriage, a sacred tie, a union of two souls and the coming together of two families as one big family. Today we are not here as the groom’s or the bride’s family but one big family.

Tonight is all about joy, happiness and excitement. It’s about dancing our way to the wedding, singing out songs and blessings and most importantly getting to know one another.

Garba is a dance that honors, worships, and celebrates the feminine form of divinity. The word "garba" comes from the Sanskrit word garbha, meaning "womb." Traditionally, the dance is performed by women in a circle around a clay lantern with a light inside, called a garbha deep ("womb lamp").

Garba is performed in a circle (concentric circles when there are many people). The circle represents the Hindu view of time. In Hinduism, time is cyclical. As the cycle of time revolves, from birth to life to death to rebirth, the only thing that is constant is the Goddess, an unmoving symbol in the midst of all of this unending and infinite movement. The dance symbolizes that God, represented in feminine form in this case, is the only thing that remains unchanging in a constantly changing universe.''',
    '''The haldi ceremony marks the beginning of the wedding rituals. The ceremony is held on the morning of the wedding day at the residence of both groom and bride respectively. A paste prepared with turmeric (haldi), curd, sandalwood, gram flour primarily, is rubbed onto the bride’s and groom’s skin before a ceremonial bath.

Turmeric is considered extremely auspicious for Hindu rituals. 
Turmeric is extremely good for the skin. It gives the skin a healthy glow and ensures the bride and the groom look fresh during the most important occasion of their lives. The beautification property of haldi makes the haldi ceremony an important ritual in Indian weddings.
Massaging the ubtan onto the skin relaxes the body and takes the mind off the tension. It also has an antioxidant called curcumin that acts as a mild counter to depression and anxiety which helps the bride and the groom stay calm for the wedding.

The colour yellow is indeed associated with new beginnings, peace and happiness.''',
